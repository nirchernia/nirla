							<p>This is dedicated to all the people who asked me for a playlist, the people who harassed me for a song title at my parties, and those that secretly Shaazam my iPod music while we drive in the car.</p> 

							<p>I have laid out quite a bit of music here, and will continue to share music that I myself vibe with. The music is varietal; I quickly bounce back and force between a multitudes of genres. NIR.AUDIO almost serves like a historical timeline of my musical taste. There aren’t specific dates that you should frequent; I just post as often as I like. It’s a hobby I enjoy.
